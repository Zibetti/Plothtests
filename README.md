## Plot hypothesis tests - R Package

This R package was made to help in demonstrate the concepts of hypothesis test, the functions will perfom and plot a hypothesis test, highlithing the test statistic, critical area and limits value, and the p-value.

To install this package just:

```markdown
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("igraph")
library(devtools)
install_github("Zibetti/Plothtests")
library(Plothtests)
```
Then you can perform a hypothesis test using a summary statistic. 

To test one populational variance (Chi-squared test)

```markdown
plot_chi_test(alpha = 0.05,alternative = "two.sided",
              df = 20, va = 20,
              vp = 15,
              annotations = TRUE,
              color = 3)
```

To test the difference of two variances (F-test)

```markdown
plot_F_test(alpha = 0.05, alternative = "two.sided",
            df1 = 10, df2 = 10,
            v1 = 1.5, v2 = 2.5,
            ratio = 1,
            annotations = TRUE,
            color = 3)
```

To test the difference of two means (T-test)

```markdown
plot_T_test(alpha = 0.05, alternative = "two.sided",
            var.equal = "equal",
            n1 = 10, m1 = 2.92, v1 = 1.5,
            n2 = 20, m2 = 4.20, v2 = 1.7,             
            delta0 = 0,
            annotations = TRUE,
            color = 3)
```
